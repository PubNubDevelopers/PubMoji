Welcome to PubMoji!

Pubmoji is an interactive phone application designed to demonstrate PubNub's capabilities. You will see just how easy it is to integrate Pub/Sub, Prescence, and other keystone multi-user features into a phone application.

Using the PubNub-React-Native SDK, PubMoji is a React-Native phone application similar to SnapChat's SnapMaps and CookieClicker:

* Multiple users are rendered on a Geographic map as either a pre-selected avatar or their very own Bitmoji.
* Each user can then spam/select up to 5 different emojis to emerge out of their head.
...

All user-data is handled securley and reliably through PubNub. Each user publishes their data across a PubNub channel of which the other users receive in realtime by subscribing to that channel. This entails instances such as rendering people on a map based on the GPS coordinates they Published or tracking each user's state by having them publish user-specific values such as UUID, GPS permission, etc.
